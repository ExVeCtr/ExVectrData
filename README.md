# ExVectrData
Part of the ExVeCtr project. 
ExVectrData offers data structures used by many systems and many types of data processing things like Kalman, Low-Pass filters etc.
## Dependencies:
The ExVectr libraries below are required by this library to function.
- Core 
- HAL.
## Current goal roadmap:
- [X] ~~Port from previous projects.~~ Not much to port. Added low and high pass filters.
- [X] Implement kalman filter.
- [ ] ~~Implement Complementary filter.~~ Too application specific and not needed. Might implement later.
- [ ] Implement Extended kalman filter.
- [ ] Implement FFT.
- [ ] Implement more stuff.
- [ ] Documentation.
## **This project is under initial development. Things will probably break.**
